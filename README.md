# Airbnb Clone Project

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Database Design

- A **User** can:
  - Own multiple Properties (1-to-many)
  - Make multiple Bookings (1-to-many)
  - Write multiple Reviews (1-to-many)

- A **Property**:
  - Belongs to one User (host)
  - Can have multiple Bookings
  - Can have multiple Reviews

- A **Booking**:
  - Belongs to one User (guest)
  - Belongs to one Property
  - Has one Payment
  - Can have one Review (after the stay)

- A **Payment**:
  - Belongs to one Booking

- A **Review**:
  - Belongs to one Booking
  - Belongs to one Property
  - Written by one User

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
- Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- The platform distinguishes between different user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin).

### 2. Property Management
- Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings.
- Each property includes title, description, location, price per night, and is linked to the host user.

### 3. Booking System
- Guests can browse available properties and create bookings by selecting desired dates.
- The system checks property availability and ensures secure booking confirmation.

### 4. Payment Processing
- Users can securely pay for bookings via supported methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
- The system tracks payment status to ensure smooth transaction management.

### 5. Review System
- After completing a stay, guests can leave ratings and reviews for properties.
- Reviews maintain quality standards and assist future guests in making decisions.

## API Security

### 1. Authentication
- Implemented using secure token-based methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Ensures only verified users can access protected parts of the platform.

### 2. Authorization
- Controls user actions based on their roles (guest, host, admin).
- Ensures data privacy and secure operations.

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Prevents abuse and DoS attacks by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.

### 4. Data Validation and Sanitization
- All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

### 5. Secure Payment Processing
- Payments handled via trusted third-party gateways (Stripe, PayPal).
- Ensures compliance with PCI-DSS security standards.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
**Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment** automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code with each update, ensuring safe and fast integration of changes.

### Why CI/CD is Important
- Increases development speed.
- Improves code quality through automated testing.
- Reduces bugs reaching production.
- Ensures faster feedback loops and reliable deployments.

### Tools We Will Use
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate workflows for testing, building, and deploying.
- **Docker**: Containerize the application for consistent environments.
- **(Optional)** AWS / Vercel / Render: For automated cloud deployment after successful builds.
