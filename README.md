The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.


Database Design
A User can:
own multiple Properties (1-to-many)
make multiple Bookings (1-to-many)
write multiple Reviews (1-to-many)

A Property:
belongs to one User (host)
can have multiple Bookings
can have multiple Reviews

A Booking:
belongs to one User (guest)
belongs to one Property
has one Payment
can have one Review (after the stay)

A Payment:
belongs to one Booking

A Review:
belongs to one Booking
belongs to one Property
written by one User

Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. The platform distinguishes between different user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin), allowing users to either book properties or list their own for rent.

2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes details like title, description, location, price per night, and is linked to the host user.

3. Booking System
Guests can browse available properties and create bookings by selecting their desired dates. The system checks for property availability and ensures secure booking confirmation.

4. Payment Processing
Users can securely pay for their bookings through supported payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal). The payment system tracks the payment status to ensure smooth transaction management.

5. Review System
After completing a stay, guests can leave ratings and reviews for properties they booked. Reviews help maintain quality standards and assist future guests in making informed decisions.

API Security
1. Authentication
We will implement authentication using secure token-based methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Authentication ensures that only verified users can access protected parts of the platform, helping safeguard user accounts and sensitive actions like bookings and payments.

2. Authorization
Authorization will control what actions a user can perform based on their role (e.g., guest, host, admin). This ensures that users can only manage their own data and that sensitive operations (like editing a property or processing a payment) are not accessible to unauthorized users.

3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting will be applied to APIs to prevent abuse and protect the system from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. By limiting the number of requests per user/IP over time, the platform ensures stability and fair use for all users.

4. Data Validation and Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This step is critical to maintaining the integrity and security of the application.

5. Secure Payment Processing
Payment information will never be stored directly on our servers. Instead, payments will be handled by trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to ensure compliance with security standards like PCI-DSS, protecting user financial information.

CI/CD Pipeline
What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code every time changes are made. This ensures that new features, bug fixes, and updates are safely and quickly integrated into the project without manual intervention.

Why CI/CD is Important
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline increases development speed, improves code quality through automated testing, and reduces the risk of bugs reaching production. It also ensures faster feedback loops and more reliable deployments, enhancing the overall stability and security of the platform.

Tools We Will Use
GitHub Actions: For automating workflows like testing, building, and deployment every time changes are pushed to the repository.

Docker: To containerize the application for consistent development, testing, and production environments.

(Optional) AWS / Vercel / Render: For automated deployment to cloud platforms once the build passes.
