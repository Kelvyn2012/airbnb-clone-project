The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

Database Design
A User can:
own multiple Properties (1-to-many)
make multiple Bookings (1-to-many)
write multiple Reviews (1-to-many)

A Property:
belongs to one User (host)
can have multiple Bookings
can have multiple Reviews

A Booking:
belongs to one User (guest)
belongs to one Property
has one Payment
can have one Review (after the stay)

A Payment:
belongs to one Booking

A Review:
belongs to one Booking
belongs to one Property
written by one User

Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. The platform distinguishes between different user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin), allowing users to either book properties or list their own for rent.

2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes details like title, description, location, price per night, and is linked to the host user.

3. Booking System
Guests can browse available properties and create bookings by selecting their desired dates. The system checks for property availability and ensures secure booking confirmation.

4. Payment Processing
Users can securely pay for their bookings through supported payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal). The payment system tracks the payment status to ensure smooth transaction management.

5. Review System
After completing a stay, guests can leave ratings and reviews for properties they booked. Reviews help maintain quality standards and assist future guests in making informed decisions.
